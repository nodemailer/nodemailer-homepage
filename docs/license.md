Nodemailer is licensed under the **MIT No Attribution (MIT-0)** license. This is one of the most permissive open-source licenses available, allowing you to use, modify, and distribute Nodemailer in any project, including commercial applications, without attribution requirements.

### License History

Version 3 of Nodemailer was briefly licensed under the **European Union Public License 1.1 (EUPL)**, a _copyleft_ license that required derivative works to be released under the same terms. For the reasoning behind that decision, see the [Nodemailer blog post](https://blog.nodemailer.com/2017/02/02/nodemailer-v3-0-0/).

After a two-month experiment, Nodemailer was reverted to the MIT license and all active subscriptions were canceled. The restrictive license proved impractical for a foundational infrastructure module like Nodemailer. Even the author had to use older versions to avoid licensing complications in client work. Additionally, paid subscriptions did not gain traction, and most users continued using Nodemailer in commercial projects regardless of the copyleft terms. Without a practical way to enforce the license, the more permissive MIT license was restored.
