# Message Playground

Use this interactive playground to experiment with Nodemailer message configuration and see a live preview of how your email will appear to recipients.

Edit the JSON configuration on the left to see the email preview update in real-time on the right. The playground supports all common message fields including `from`, `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `subject`, `text`, and `html`.

<EmailPlayground />

## Supported fields

The playground supports the following message configuration fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `from` | Sender address (string or object with `name` and `address`) |
| `to` | Recipient address(es) - string, array, or object |
| `cc` | Carbon copy recipient(s) |
| `bcc` | Blind carbon copy recipient(s) |
| `replyTo` | Reply-to address(es) |
| `subject` | Email subject line |
| `text` | Plain text message body |
| `html` | HTML message body (takes precedence over `text`) |
| `attachments` | Array of attachment objects (see limitations below) |

:::tip
If you only provide a `text` field without `html`, the playground will automatically convert the plain text to a simple HTML representation for preview purposes.
:::

:::warning Attachment limitations
The playground only supports attachments with base64-encoded content. Other content sources (file paths, URLs, streams, buffers) are not available in the browser environment. Each attachment must include:
- `content` - Base64-encoded string
- `encoding` - Must be set to `"base64"`
- `filename` - Name of the file
- `contentType` - MIME type (optional, detected from filename if omitted)
- `cid` - Content-ID for embedding images in HTML (optional)

Attachments with a `cid` value can be referenced in HTML using `<img src="cid:your-cid-value">`.

## Address formats

You can specify email addresses in several formats:

```json
// Plain email address
"to": "recipient@example.com"

// With display name
"to": "\"Recipient Name\" <recipient@example.com>"

// Object format
"to": { "name": "Recipient Name", "address": "recipient@example.com" }

// Multiple recipients (array)
"to": ["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com"]

// Multiple recipients (comma-separated)
"to": "user1@example.com, user2@example.com"
```

For more details on message configuration, see the [message configuration reference](./index.md).
