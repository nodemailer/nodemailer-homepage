> **In shortÂ ðŸš€** â€“ PHP ships with a full mail stack, while Node.js keeps things lean.
> If your server does **not** have a local _sendmail_ binary, you will need an **SMTP service** (recommended) or to install _sendmail_ yourself.

## PHPâ€™s Hidden Mail Stack

When you call `mail()` in PHP it looks effortless, but a _lot_ of software is doing the real work under the hood:

1. **Web server** â€“ usually Apache orâ€¯Nginx
2. **PHPâ€‘FPM / CGI** â€“ glues the web server to the PHP interpreter
3. **PHP interpreter** â€“ runs your script
4. **sendmail** (or Postfix/Exim) â€“ queues the message and hands it off to the recipientâ€™s MX server

Because _sendmail_ is already installed on most LAMP stacks, PHP can simply stream your message to the binaryâ€™s **stdin** and call it a day.

## Node.js: Slim by Design

A typical Node.js deployment bundles **only** the things your application needsâ€”often nothing more than the _node_ executable.
If _sendmail_ is not present on that server, the quick oneâ€‘liner PHP enjoys simply isnâ€™t possible.

Thatâ€™s where **Nodemailer** comes in: it lets you choose between

- **sendmail transport** â€“ identical behaviour to PHPâ€™s `mail()`, _but only if_ a local _sendmail_ binary is available, and
- **SMTP transport** â€“ connect to any SMTP host (Gmail, SES, Mailgun, your own Postfix,Â â€¦)

## Using _sendmail_ with Nodemailer

```js
const nodemailer = require("nodemailer");

// Works only if /usr/sbin/sendmail (or equivalent) exists
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  sendmail: true,
  newline: "unix",
  path: "/usr/sbin/sendmail",
});

await transporter.sendMail({
  from: "you@example.com",
  to: "friend@example.net",
  subject: "Hello from sendmail",
  text: "This message was handed to the local sendmail binary.",
});
```

See the [sendmail transport](/transports/sendmail) documentation for all options.

## Using an external SMTP service (recommended)

```js
const nodemailer = require("nodemailer");

// Connect to an SMTP host
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: "smtp.example.com",
  port: 587,
  secure: false, // upgrade later with STARTTLS
  auth: {
    user: "smtpâ€‘user",
    pass: "smtpâ€‘password",
  },
});

await transporter.sendMail({
  from: "you@example.com",
  to: "friend@example.net",
  subject: "Hello from SMTP",
  text: "This message travelled through smtp.example.com.",
});
```

### Why SMTP is usually the safer bet

- **Availability** â€“ cloud platforms (Vercel, Heroku, AWSÂ ELB `docker run`,Â â€¦) rarely provide _sendmail_.
- **Deliverability** â€“ reputable SMTP providers handle IP reputation, DKIM/DMARC/ARC signing, and feedback loops for you.
- **Scalability** â€“ you can queue and monitor thousands of messages without managing a mail server.
- **Support** â€“ when something goes wrong, managed SMTP gives you logs, dashboards, and alerts.

If you _do_ control the server environment (e.g. a traditional VPS) and already have a properly configured MTA, Nodemailerâ€™s sendmail transport offers a dropâ€‘in replacement for PHPâ€™s `mail()`.
