Sendmail transport pipes the generated RFC822 message to the standard input of the **sendmail** command, so it's the same thing what the **mail()** function in PHP does.

To use Sendmail transport, set **sendmail** in Nodemailer transport options to _true_.

The additional options to use with this transport are the following:

- **path** - path to the **sendmail** command (defaults to _'sendmail'_)
- **newline** - either _'windows'_ or _'unix'_ (default). Forces all newlines in the output to either use Windows syntax &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; or Unix syntax &lt;LF&gt;
- **args** - an optional array of command line options to pass to the **sendmail** command (ie. `["-f", "foo@example.com"]`). This overrides all default arguments except for _'-i'_ and recipient list so you need to make sure you have all required arguments set (ie. the '-f' flag).

The command to be spawned by default looks like this:

```sh
sendmail -i -f from_addr to_addr[]
```

If **args** property was provided then the command looks like this:

```sh
sendmail -i args[] to_addr[]
```

The **info** argument for **sendMail()** callback includes the following properties:

- **envelope** – is an envelope object `{from:'address', to:['address']}`
- **messageId** – is the Message-ID header value

#### Not Able to send Mail using sendmail transport ?

If `createTransport` function is not taking up the path which by default is '/usr/bin/sendmail', make sure you have sendmail configured in your system. Take a look at [Source](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/usendmai.htm) (for linux/unix).

### Examples

#### 1\. Send a message using specific binary

This example pipes message to a custom command using unix-style newlines. Sendmail does not produce any output besides the exit code, so there's nothing else to return with the callback.

```javascript
let transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  sendmail: true,
  newline: "unix",
  path: "/usr/sbin/sendmail",
});
transporter.sendMail(
  {
    from: "sender@example.com",
    to: "recipient@example.com",
    subject: "Message",
    text: "I hope this message gets delivered!",
  },
  (err, info) => {
    console.log(info.envelope);
    console.log(info.messageId);
  }
);
```
