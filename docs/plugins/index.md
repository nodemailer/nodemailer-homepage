# Plugins

Nodemailer can be extended with plugins. In most cases there are 3 different kind of plugins.

1. Plugins that operate on the mail object (for example extend it or change existing values). This is the pre-processing step
2. Plugins that operate on mail stream (for example to calculate message signatures). This is the processing step
3. Plugins that operate as transports (for example to send the message using an API of some delivery provider). This is the sending step
