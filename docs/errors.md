This page documents all error codes and error types that Nodemailer and related packages can produce. Understanding these errors will help you diagnose issues and implement proper error handling in your application.

## Error object structure

When Nodemailer encounters an error, it creates an Error object with additional properties that provide context about what went wrong.

| Property       | Type     | Description                                                                                          |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `message`      | `string` | A human-readable description of the error.                                                           |
| `code`         | `string` | An error code that identifies the type of error (such as `ECONNECTION` or `EAUTH`).                  |
| `command`      | `string` | The SMTP command that was being executed when the error occurred (such as `CONN`, `AUTH LOGIN`).     |
| `response`     | `string` | The raw response string from the SMTP server, if available.                                          |
| `responseCode` | `number` | The numeric SMTP response code from the server (such as `535` for authentication failure).           |

Example error object:

```javascript
{
  message: 'Invalid login: 535 5.7.8 Authentication failed',
  code: 'EAUTH',
  command: 'AUTH PLAIN',
  response: '535 5.7.8 Authentication failed',
  responseCode: 535
}
```

## Error codes

Nodemailer uses specific error codes to categorize different types of failures. These codes are set on the `error.code` property.

### Connection errors

#### ECONNECTION

A general connection error occurred. This typically happens when:

- The connection to the SMTP server failed to establish
- The connection was closed unexpectedly during a transaction
- The server terminated the connection (response code 421)
- The socket encountered an error

**Common causes:**
- Incorrect hostname or port configuration
- Firewall blocking the connection
- Server is down or unreachable
- Network connectivity issues

**Troubleshooting:**
- Verify the `host` and `port` settings in your transport configuration
- Check if your network allows outbound connections on the specified port
- Try using `telnet hostname port` to test basic connectivity
- Ensure the SMTP server is running and accepting connections

#### ETIMEDOUT

The operation timed out. This can occur in several scenarios:

- Connection timeout: Failed to establish TCP connection within the allowed time
- Greeting timeout: Server did not send initial greeting after connection was established
- Socket timeout: No activity on the connection for too long

**Default timeout values:**
- Connection timeout: 2 minutes (120000 ms)
- Greeting timeout: 30 seconds (30000 ms)
- Socket timeout: 10 minutes (600000 ms)

**Troubleshooting:**
- Increase timeout values in your transport configuration if network is slow
- Check for network latency issues between your server and the SMTP server
- Verify that the SMTP server is responsive

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: "smtp.example.com",
  port: 587,
  connectionTimeout: 60000, // 1 minute
  greetingTimeout: 30000,   // 30 seconds
  socketTimeout: 300000,    // 5 minutes
});
```

#### EDNS

DNS resolution failed. The hostname could not be resolved to an IP address.

**Common causes:**
- Incorrect hostname (typo in the domain name)
- DNS server is unreachable
- The domain does not exist

**Troubleshooting:**
- Verify the hostname is correct
- Test DNS resolution: `nslookup smtp.example.com`
- Check your DNS server configuration

#### ESOCKET

A low-level socket error occurred. This is typically an error passed through from Node.js net or tls modules.

**Common causes:**
- Network interruption during communication
- Connection reset by peer (ECONNRESET)
- Broken pipe (EPIPE)

### TLS/SSL errors

#### ETLS

A TLS-related error occurred. This can happen during:

- Initial TLS connection (when using `secure: true` with port 465)
- STARTTLS upgrade (when upgrading from unencrypted to encrypted connection)
- TLS certificate validation

**Common causes:**
- Invalid or self-signed TLS certificate
- Certificate hostname mismatch
- TLS version incompatibility
- STARTTLS command failed

**Troubleshooting:**
- For self-signed certificates in development, use `tls: { rejectUnauthorized: false }`
- Ensure the server certificate is valid and not expired
- Set `tls.servername` if connecting via IP address
- Check if the server supports your TLS version

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: "smtp.example.com",
  port: 465,
  secure: true,
  tls: {
    // Do not fail on invalid certs (use only in development!)
    rejectUnauthorized: false,
    // Specify server name for SNI
    servername: "smtp.example.com",
  },
});
```

### Authentication errors

#### EAUTH

Authentication failed. The server rejected the provided credentials or authentication method.

**Common causes:**
- Incorrect username or password
- Account is locked or disabled
- Authentication method not supported by server
- OAuth2 token expired or invalid
- Two-factor authentication enabled without app-specific password

**The `command` property indicates which authentication step failed:**
- `AUTH LOGIN` - LOGIN authentication method
- `AUTH PLAIN` - PLAIN authentication method
- `AUTH CRAM-MD5` - CRAM-MD5 authentication method
- `AUTH XOAUTH2` - OAuth2 authentication

**Troubleshooting:**
- Verify your username and password are correct
- For Gmail, use an App Password if 2FA is enabled
- For OAuth2, ensure your access token is valid and not expired
- Check if the server supports your chosen authentication method

```javascript
// Using App Password for Gmail
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: "gmail",
  auth: {
    user: "your.email@gmail.com",
    pass: "your-16-char-app-password", // Not your regular password!
  },
});
```

#### ENOAUTH

Authentication credentials were not provided when the server requires authentication (and `forceAuth` option is set).

**Troubleshooting:**
- Add the `auth` object to your transport configuration
- Ensure both `user` and `pass` properties are set

#### EOAUTH2

An OAuth2-specific error occurred during token generation or refresh.

**Common causes:**
- Missing required options (`privateKey` and `user` for service accounts)
- Refresh token is invalid or revoked
- JWT signing failed
- OAuth server returned an error response
- No access token in server response

**Troubleshooting:**
- Verify your OAuth2 credentials are correct
- Check if the refresh token is still valid
- For service accounts, ensure the private key is properly formatted
- Review the error message for specific OAuth server error details

```javascript
// OAuth2 configuration example
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: "gmail",
  auth: {
    type: "OAuth2",
    user: "your.email@gmail.com",
    clientId: "your-client-id",
    clientSecret: "your-client-secret",
    refreshToken: "your-refresh-token",
  },
});
```

### Envelope errors

#### EENVELOPE

The message envelope is invalid. This relates to the MAIL FROM and RCPT TO commands.

**Common causes:**
- No recipients defined (empty `to`, `cc`, and `bcc`)
- Invalid sender address format
- Invalid recipient address format
- All recipients were rejected by the server
- Server rejected the sender address
- Internationalized email addresses when server does not support SMTPUTF8

**Error scenarios:**
- `No recipients defined` - No valid recipients in the envelope
- `Invalid sender` - The from address contains invalid characters
- `Invalid recipient` - A recipient address contains invalid characters
- `Can't send mail - all recipients were rejected` - Server rejected every recipient
- `Mail command failed` - Server rejected the sender address
- `Recipient command failed` - Server rejected a recipient address
- `Data command failed` - Server rejected the DATA command
- `Internationalized mailbox name not allowed` - Unicode address used without SMTPUTF8 support

**Troubleshooting:**
- Ensure at least one recipient is specified
- Verify email addresses do not contain special characters like `<`, `>`, or newlines
- Check server logs for why addresses were rejected
- For rejected recipients, check the `rejected` and `rejectedErrors` arrays in the error

```javascript
try {
  await transporter.sendMail(message);
} catch (err) {
  if (err.code === 'EENVELOPE') {
    console.log('Rejected recipients:', err.rejected);
    console.log('Rejection details:', err.rejectedErrors);
  }
}
```

### Message errors

#### EMESSAGE

The message content is invalid or was rejected by the server.

**Common causes:**
- Empty message body
- Message size exceeds server limit
- Server rejected the message after DATA command
- Message content violated server policies

**Troubleshooting:**
- Ensure message has content (text or html body)
- Check if message size exceeds the server's SIZE limit
- Review message content for policy violations (spam filters, etc.)

### Stream errors

#### ESTREAM

An error occurred while reading the message stream. This typically happens when using streams for message content or attachments.

**Common causes:**
- Source stream emitted an error
- File not found when using file path for attachment
- Network error when fetching URL content

**Troubleshooting:**
- Verify file paths exist and are readable
- Handle stream errors before passing to Nodemailer
- Check network connectivity for URL-based content

### Protocol errors

#### EPROTOCOL

The server response did not follow the expected SMTP protocol format.

**Common causes:**
- Invalid greeting response (not starting with 220)
- Invalid EHLO/HELO response
- Unexpected response to a command
- Server is not actually an SMTP server

**Troubleshooting:**
- Verify you are connecting to an SMTP server (not HTTP, IMAP, etc.)
- Check the port number is correct for SMTP
- Review server logs for protocol issues

### Pool-specific errors

#### EMAXLIMIT

The connection pool has reached its maximum number of connections or send retries.

**Common causes:**
- All pooled connections are busy
- Maximum retry limit reached after connection failures
- Connection pool is exhausted

**Troubleshooting:**
- Increase `maxConnections` in pool configuration
- Reduce message sending rate
- Check for connection leaks (connections not being released)

### Configuration errors

#### ECONFIG

The transport configuration is invalid or uses a deprecated format.

**Common causes:**
- Using legacy SES configuration format (pre-v7.0.0)
- Invalid transport options

**Troubleshooting:**
- Update your configuration to use the current API format
- For SES, use `@aws-sdk/client-sesv2` instead of the legacy SDK
- Review the Nodemailer documentation for current options

### Proxy errors

#### EPROXY

An error occurred while connecting through a proxy server.

**Common causes:**
- Invalid proxy URL or configuration
- Proxy server returned an error response
- SOCKS module not loaded for SOCKS proxy
- Unknown proxy protocol

**Troubleshooting:**
- Verify your proxy URL is correct (e.g., `http://proxy.example.com:3128`)
- For SOCKS proxies, ensure the `socks` module is installed
- Check proxy server logs for connection issues

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: "smtp.example.com",
  port: 587,
  proxy: "http://proxy.example.com:3128",
});
```

### Content access errors

#### EFILEACCESS

File access was rejected because `disableFileAccess` option is enabled.

**When this occurs:**
- Attempting to use a file path for attachment content when `disableFileAccess: true`
- This is a security feature to prevent reading local files

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you need file attachments, set `disableFileAccess: false` (default)
- Use Buffer or stream content instead of file paths

```javascript
// This will throw EFILEACCESS if disableFileAccess is true
const message = {
  attachments: [{ path: "/path/to/file.pdf" }],
};

// Safe alternative - use content directly
const message = {
  attachments: [{ content: fs.readFileSync("/path/to/file.pdf") }],
};
```

#### EURLACCESS

URL access was rejected because `disableUrlAccess` option is enabled.

**When this occurs:**
- Attempting to use a URL for attachment content when `disableUrlAccess: true`
- This is a security feature to prevent fetching remote content

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you need URL-based attachments, set `disableUrlAccess: false` (default)
- Fetch the content yourself and pass it as a Buffer

```javascript
// This will throw EURLACCESS if disableUrlAccess is true
const message = {
  attachments: [{ href: "https://example.com/file.pdf" }],
};
```

#### EFETCH

An HTTP fetch error occurred when retrieving remote content.

**Common causes:**
- Network error while fetching URL content
- HTTP request timeout
- Invalid status code from server
- Maximum redirect count exceeded

**Troubleshooting:**
- Verify the URL is accessible
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure the server returns a successful status code

### TLS extension errors

#### EREQUIRETLS

The REQUIRETLS extension (RFC 8689) was requested but not supported by the server.

**When this occurs:**
- `requireTLSExtensionEnabled: true` is set in the message options
- The SMTP server does not advertise REQUIRETLS capability

**Troubleshooting:**
- Check if your SMTP server supports RFC 8689 REQUIRETLS
- Remove `requireTLSExtensionEnabled` option if the server does not support it
- Use a server that supports REQUIRETLS for high-security email delivery

```javascript
const message = {
  from: "sender@example.com",
  to: "recipient@example.com",
  subject: "Secure message",
  text: "This requires TLS throughout delivery",
  requireTLSExtensionEnabled: true, // Requires server support
};
```

### Transport-specific errors

#### ESENDMAIL

An error occurred with the sendmail transport.

**Common causes:**
- Sendmail binary not found (exit code 127)
- Sendmail process exited with non-zero code
- Invalid envelope addresses (addresses starting with `-`)
- Sendmail binary could not be spawned

**Troubleshooting:**
- Verify sendmail is installed and in the system PATH
- Check the sendmail path configuration
- Ensure envelope addresses are valid

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  sendmail: true,
  path: "/usr/sbin/sendmail", // Explicit path if needed
});
```

#### ESES

An error occurred with the AWS SES transport. These are typically errors passed through from the AWS SDK.

## SMTP response codes

When communicating with SMTP servers, you may receive numeric response codes. The `responseCode` property on errors contains this value.

### Success codes (2xx)

| 555  | MAIL FROM/RCPT TO parameters not recognized                                |

## SES transport errors

When using the Amazon SES transport, errors have the code `ESES` and include the underlying AWS SDK error. Common SES error codes include:

| Code                   | Meaning                                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `InvalidParameterValue`| Invalid parameter in the API request               |
| `MessageRejected`      | SES rejected the message (content policy violation)|

## Sendmail transport errors

When using the sendmail transport, errors have the code `ESENDMAIL`. Errors are generated based on the sendmail process exit code:

| Exit Code | Error Message                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 127       | Sendmail command not found, process exited with code 127|
| Other     | Sendmail exited with code X                             |

Additional sendmail errors:
- `Can not send mail. Invalid envelope addresses.` - Address starts with `-` (security risk)
- `sendmail was not found` - Sendmail binary could not be spawned

## OAuth2 errors

When using OAuth2 authentication, errors have the code `EOAUTH2`. Common error messages include:

| Error Message                                      | Cause                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `Can't create new access token for user`           | No refresh mechanism available and token expired   |
| `Can't generate token. Check your auth options`    | JWT signing failed (service account)               |
| `Invalid authentication response`                  | OAuth server returned invalid response             |
| `No access token`                                  | OAuth server response did not include access token |
| `Options "privateKey" and "user" are required...`  | Missing required options for service account       |

OAuth error responses from the server follow RFC 6749 format and are included in the error message:
```
error: error_description (error_uri)
```

## Error handling best practices

### Basic error handling

```javascript
try {
  const info = await transporter.sendMail(message);
  console.log('Message sent:', info.messageId);
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Send failed:', err.message);
  console.error('Error code:', err.code);

  if (err.responseCode) {
    console.error('SMTP response:', err.responseCode, err.response);
  }
}
```

### Handling specific error types

```javascript
try {
  await transporter.sendMail(message);
} catch (err) {
  switch (err.code) {
    case 'ECONNECTION':
    case 'ETIMEDOUT':
    case 'EDNS':
    case 'ESOCKET':
      console.error('Network error - will retry later');
      // Schedule retry
      break;

    case 'EAUTH':
    case 'ENOAUTH':
      console.error('Authentication failed - check credentials');
      // Do not retry without fixing credentials
      break;

    case 'EOAUTH2':
      console.error('OAuth2 error - check token configuration');
      // Refresh token or re-authenticate
      break;

    case 'EENVELOPE':
      console.error('Invalid recipients:', err.rejected);
      // Remove invalid recipients and retry
      break;

    case 'EMESSAGE':
      console.error('Message rejected by server');
      // Check message content
      break;

    case 'ETLS':
    case 'EREQUIRETLS':
      console.error('TLS/Security error');
      // Check TLS configuration
      break;

    case 'ECONFIG':
      console.error('Configuration error');
      // Review transport configuration
      break;

    case 'ESENDMAIL':
      console.error('Sendmail error');
      // Check sendmail installation
      break;

    default:
      console.error('Unexpected error:', err);
  }
}
```

### Verifying configuration before sending

Use `transporter.verify()` to test your configuration:

```javascript
try {
  await transporter.verify();
  console.log('Server is ready to accept messages');
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Configuration error:', err.message);
}
```

### Handling partial failures

When some recipients are rejected but others accepted:

```javascript
const info = await transporter.sendMail(message);

if (info.rejected && info.rejected.length > 0) {
  console.log('Message sent, but some recipients were rejected:');
  console.log('Accepted:', info.accepted);
  console.log('Rejected:', info.rejected);

  if (info.rejectedErrors) {
    info.rejectedErrors.forEach(err => {
      console.log(`  ${err.recipient}: ${err.message}`);
    });
  }
}
```
