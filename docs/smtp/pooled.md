If pooling is used then Nodemailer keeps a fixed amount of connections open and sends the next message once a connection becomes available. It is mostly useful when you have a large number of messages that you want to send in batches or your provider allows you to only use a small amount of parallel connections.

To use pooled connections use the following options in transport configuration

- **pool** – set to _true_ to use pooled connections (defaults to _false_) instead of creating a new connection for every email
- **maxConnections** – is the count of maximum simultaneous connections to make against the SMTP server (defaults to 5)
- **maxMessages** – limits the message count to be sent using a single connection (defaults to 100). After _maxMessages_ is reached the connection is dropped and a new one is created for the following messages

##### Deprecated options

The following options are deprecated and will be removed from future versions of Nodemailer.

- **rateDelta** – defines the time measuring period in milliseconds (defaults to 1000, ie. to 1 second) for rate limiting
- **rateLimit** – limits the message count to be sent in **rateDelta** time. Once _rateLimit_ is reached, sending is paused until the end of the measuring period. This limit is shared between connections, so if one connection uses up the limit, then other connections are paused as well. If _rateLimit_ is not set then sending rate is not limited

### Methods

#### transporter.isIdle()

Returns _true_ if there are available connection slots

#### transporter.close()

If transporter uses pooling then connections are kept open even if there is nothing to be sent. Connections that idle for longer than the _socketTimeout_ will be closed automatically and reopened once there's more mail to send. You can also use _transporter.close()_ to clean up all connections.

```javascript
let transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({pool: true,...});
// ...
transporter.close();
```

### Events

#### Event:'idle'

Emitted by the transporter object if connection pool has free connection slots. Check if a connection is still available with `isIdle()` method (returns `true` if a connection is still available). This allows to create push-like senders where messages are not queued into memory in a Node.js process but pushed and loaded through an external queue.

```javascript
let messages = [..."list of messages"];
transporter.on("idle", function () {
  // send next message from the pending queue
  while (transporter.isIdle() && messages.length) {
    transporter.sendMail(messages.shift());
  }
});
```
